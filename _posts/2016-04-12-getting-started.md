# Getting Started

with Hypnotherapy, Psychotherapy & Coaching in Bristol....  It's easy!

It couldn't be easier.  All you need to do
is book an initial consultation.  Liane
or Sam will explain in clear text just how the brain works in relation to your
issue or desired goal.  But more
importantly, you'll find out how hypnotherapy has helped 1000s of people not
only to cope better, but to go on and achieve the most amazing positive lasting
changes that brighten up all aspects of their home and work life.

You will of course get to ask questions, and although it's
not necessary to understand exactly how hypnotherapy works, you will learn the
basics of what you need to know to go on and get on top of things, within a
relatively short period, which can be as little as a few weeks!

So why not get in touch today, and get the ball rolling....
