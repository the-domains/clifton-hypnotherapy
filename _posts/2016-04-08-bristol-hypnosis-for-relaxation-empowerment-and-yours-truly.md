## Bristol Hypnosis for Relaxation, Empowerment & Yours Truly

Relaxation is not just relaxation, it might just be the most powerful tool available for combatting Stress, Anxiety & Depression, whilst maximising Self Esteem, boosting confidence, and catapulting you into your full potential.

Why?  Because when you are relaxed and calm, Anxiety and Stress does not exist, because you're doing the opposite instead.  You simply can't be on high alert, and be on top of your stress bucket stuff at the same time.

Here at Clifton Hypnotherapy we have the tools ready and waiting to help you realise and achieve your own solutions, whilst keeping you on intellectual and controlled end of the human spectrum.  Using hypnosis, we can then utilise the focused state of attention that is the trance state, in order to get your mind working towards the goals and ideals, which you want to achieve.
