Originally from Germany, Liane has followed many aspects of the positive psychology movement since before she moved to Bristol over 10 years ago.

She has now decided to stay, and has set up her full time practice offering hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, and coaching in Bristol & South Gloucestershire. Liane loves providing the friendly, expert, and professional help that gets people where they want to be and beyond.

News travels fast, and because of the 100's of people she has helped, many of her clients now come through referrals. After all, it's the client who tell their success story better than anyone, and they know in no uncertain terms, that they have found a true gem.
