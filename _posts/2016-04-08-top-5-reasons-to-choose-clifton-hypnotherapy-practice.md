# Top 5 Reasons to Choose Clifton Hypnotherapy Practice

**1)** In order to get good at anything, it takes practice. Here at changes welcome we see more client per week then 3/4's of the entire NCH membership. In short, this means that we get a lot of practice!

**2)** Our Hypnotherapy qualifications are top of the game. Furthermore, we have great deal of further training under our belts in highly relevant areas, because we want to ensure that we keep the edge.

**3)** And it doesn't stop there. We consistently work hard to ensure that our learning is ongoing, undergoing continuous professional development. Because we want to make sure we're bang up to date.

**4)** We are recognised by and bonafide members of several important official organisations and associations such as the CNHC (Complementary & Natural Healthcare Council), the AfSFH (Association for Solution Focused Hypnotherapy) & the NCH (National Council for Hypnotherapy).

**5)** But don't just take our word for it, check out the huge number of testimonials, client success stories & interviews on our [regional website][0].
