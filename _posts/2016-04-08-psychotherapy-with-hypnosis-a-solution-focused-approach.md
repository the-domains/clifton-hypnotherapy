## with Hypnosis...a Solution Focused Approach

Solution focused, forward thinking, and positive. The help and coaching we offer our clients does not attempt to uncover the root cause of the terrible and unfortunate past events of your life.

We believe that whatever you focus on gets bigger. This is because it will only take on increased significance within both our conscious awareness, and our subconscious behavioural habits and responses. That's why we need to get good at doing the opposite. We may not have all the answers, but we certainly know which questions to ask, and can show you the scientific reason why you can make huge and lasting positive changes in your life.

Starting today, you can already make a start, by looking out for the good things that do happen. Ask yourself what was good about your day, and what will be good about tomorrow, if you are willing to take those first steps.
