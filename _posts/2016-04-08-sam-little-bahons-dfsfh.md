# Sam Little BA(hons) DSFH
![Hypnotherapist in Westbury & Clifton - Sam Little DSFH](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/53397501-2970-42e5-91aa-85c3a38dcd25.png)

Sam joined Clifton Hypnotherapy Practice in 2015, because it just made good sense.  His training is almost identical to Liane's, but his background and experience is not.  This gives them a solid basis on which to base the services, sessions, and programmes, which they offer, whilst they each have different additional skills to bring to the mix.

When he is not working with individual clients, Sam routinely runs continuous professional development workshops and seminars for businesses, organisations and government departments.  His position here also provides a variety of choice of therapist, if you are looking to see a man!

A relative new comer to Clifton Hypnotherapy, Sam already runs busy practice days in Gloucestershire (Nailsworth & Berkeley) and Westbury-on-Trym.
